# Deploy to Heroku

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It's great for beginners to get their apps running quickly on the internet, perfect for Isobel apps.

## Get started

First, create a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account, and a new Repository for your project. Call it whatever you like (e.g. isobel-app).

Run through the Getting Started guide, as well as the docs for cloud-compatible caching strategies like [Dropbox](https://isobeljs.com/packages-dropbox-readme) or [Amazon S3](https://isobeljs.com/packages-s3-readme). Note that the 'File System' caching strategy is incompatible with Heroku. We recommend taking a look at the ['basic' example](https://github.com/nathsimpson/isobel/blob/master/examples/basic/index.js), which is ready to go with Heroku.

Once you are happy, push this code to GitHub.

## Heroku-specific steps

Ok, now that we are done dev-ing on our local machine, let's get this onto the internets!

Head to [heroku.com](https://heroku.com), and sign up for a free account. Then, create a new app. Call it whatever you like and choose a region that is close to you.

Under Deployment Method, choose GitHub and link your GitHub account to Heroku. Then, choose the GitHub repository with your Isobel app in it. Once connected, click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'. This means your Isobel app will update every time you push to your Master branch on GitHub.

We now have to specify a 'buildpack', which is the software Heroku wil use to run our app. Go to Settings > Buildpacks, and tap 'Node.js'. We need to re-deploy to start using the Buildpack, so head to Deploy > 'Deploy Branch', and wait for deploy to complete.

All good? Click 'Open App' in the top right corner. Do you get a Error 404? That's fine! add `/welcome` to the end of the URL. You will get the following...

```
Hello. My name is ISOBEL
```

The system works! ðŸŽ‰

Head to `/nasa`, and you should information for the NASA Photo of the Day.

## Mission Complete

Congratulations!! You have successfully deployed a Isobel app to the Internet. That's massive. You should be super proud.

Where to from here? Now the world is your oyster. You can add one of the premade Isobel services available, or even create your own! Then, it's time to use that data an display it on your website. Guides for that are outside the scope for these docs, but if your app performs a `fetch` request to the Isobel URL for your service, you can then start creating objects in your apps.

Happy hacking!
